A simple discord bot that imports a quote book from google drive and generates a random quote from the .txt file on request in discord.

Some of the source needs to be edited in order for the code to run, like the discord bot token of your bot in the discord_bot.py file

The google drive import function is not necessary.

This bot has 4 main commands:

.quote - randomly quotes a person from the quote_book.txt

.quotebook (name) - quotes a selected person from the quotebook, if no quotes exist, returns as such

.leaderboard - returns the top 3 most quoted people

.help - lists all available commands
